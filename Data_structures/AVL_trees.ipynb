    "# AVL\n",
    "\n",
    "The **AVL** Tree is a type of Binary Search Tree named after two Soviet inventors Georgy **A**delson-**V**elsky and Evgenii **L**andis who invented the AVL Tree in 1962.\n",
    "\n",
    "AVL trees are self-balancing, which means that the tree height is kept to a minimum so that a very fast runtime is guaranteed for searching, inserting and deleting nodes, with time complexity O(logn).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantage \n",
    "\n",
    "A Binary Search Tree is in balance when the difference in height between left and right subtrees is **less than 2**.\n",
    "\n",
    "By keeping balance, the AVL Tree **ensures a minimum tree height**, which means that **search, insert, and delete operations** can be done really fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Balance Factor\n",
    "\n",
    "A node's balance factor is the difference in subtree heights.\n",
    "\n",
    "The subtree heights are stored at each node for all nodes in an AVL Tree, and the balance factor is calculated based on its subtree heights to check if the tree has become out of balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The height of a subtree is the number of edges between the root node of the subtree and the leaf node farthest down in that subtree."
