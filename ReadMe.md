# DSA 

Learning the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms, including algorithmic thinking, time and space complexity, and Big-O notation, to build a strong analytical foundation.

## Progress
- Linear Data Structures: Linked Lists, stacks, queues
- Non Linear Data Structures: Binary trees, Binary Search Trees (transversal techniques and efficient data organisation)
- Priority Based and Constant-time lookup strategies (Heaps and hashing)
- Search algorithms 
- Recursion 
- Hands-on Practice and Consolidation

## Big O

Time Complexity -- measure of the number of operations it takes to complete a task

Space Complexity -- measure of the memory space occupied by a program as it runs

### Worst Case Scenario 

> **Using an Example**
>
> with `1 2 3 4 5 6 7` a group of numbers and you are supposed to find one number

$\omega$ - best case scenario (looking for number 1 takes only one step)

$\theta$ - average time (takes 4 steps)

$\omicron$ - worst case scenario (takes all the sevens steps)

> The focus of this study is to understand the worst case

### Big O O(n)
